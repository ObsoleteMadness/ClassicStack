# Spec Errata

This document records places where ClassicStack's wire behavior intentionally differs from the published spec, because the spec contradicts what real clients actually require. Each entry cites the spec section we deviate from, the client behavior that drove the change, and the file/function where the deviation lives.

## CIFS / SMB1

### SMB_COM_SEARCH FileName padding ([MS-CIFS] 2.2.4.58.2)

**Spec:** *"The character string MUST be padded with ' ' (space) characters, as necessary, to reach 12 bytes in length. The final byte of the field MUST contain the terminating null character."* — i.e. `MYFILE.TXT  \0`.

**Observed:** Windows for Workgroups 3.11 treats the 13-byte FileName field as a NUL-terminated C string starting at byte 0. With spec-compliant space padding, the File Manager UI shows entries as `FOOD       ` (spaces visible in column, can't be opened by name).

**What we do:** NUL-pad after the name (`FOOD\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0`). This matches Samba and NT4's behavior, and is what every real CIFS client actually expects.

**Where:** `service/smb/command_fs_search.go` — `formatSearchFileName`.

### SMB_COM_READ_MPX ([MS-CIFS] 2.2.4.23)

**Spec:** *"The server returns the requested data in one or more response messages. Each response carries Offset, Count, DataLength, and DataOffset; the client reassembles by file Offset and stops once Count bytes have been delivered."* — i.e. a single well-formed WCT=8 response with `Count == DataLength` and `Remaining = 0xFFFF` should satisfy the read.

**Observed:** Windows for Workgroups 3.11 / Win9x over Direct IPX (NT LM 0.12 dialect) silently rejects spec-compliant single-response replies. The client retransmits the same Read MPX request at file offset 0 forever, never advancing — see `captures/ipx.pcap` frames 365–393 (FID 0x0003, MID 35457, MaxCount 4096) and frames 415+ (FID 0x0004). The response on the wire was structurally correct: WCT=8, Offset=0, Count=4096, Remaining=0xFFFF, DataLength=4096, DataOffset=52, ByteCount=4097, valid Pad+Data. The exact reason Win9x refuses it is unknown; the multi-response streaming form may be required, or some MID/dialect quirk we have not reverse-engineered.

**What we do:** Reject with `ERRSRV/ERRuseSTD` (`STATUS_SMB_USE_STANDARD`), which prompts the client to fall back to `SMB_COM_READ`. This is exactly what Samba's `reply_readbmpx` (source3/smbd/reply.c) has done since the 1990s. Costs one extra round-trip per chunk; in exchange the transfer actually completes.

**Where:** `service/smb/command_file_io.go` — `handleReadMPX`.

### SMB_COM_SEARCH MaxCount ([MS-CIFS] 2.2.4.58.1)

**Spec:** *"This value represents the maximum number of entries across the entirety of the search, not just the initial response."*

**Observed:** WfW 3.11 sends `MaxCount=1` on the initial Search request and `MaxCount=20` on every continuation. A strict session-wide reading would mean the first response exhausts the budget and we should immediately return ERRnofiles to every continuation — but WfW clearly expects the per-response semantics, and so does every other observed CIFS client.

**What we do:** Treat MaxCount as a per-response cap: return up to MaxCount entries from this call, retain the rest under the search handle for the next continuation.

**Where:** `service/smb/command_fs_search.go` — `handleSearch`.
