# Spec Errata

This document records places where ClassicStack's wire behavior intentionally differs from the published spec, because the spec contradicts what real clients actually require. Each entry cites the spec section we deviate from, the client behavior that drove the change, and the file/function where the deviation lives.

## CIFS / SMB1

### SMB_COM_SEARCH FileName padding ([MS-CIFS] 2.2.4.58.2)

**Spec:** *"The character string MUST be padded with ' ' (space) characters, as necessary, to reach 12 bytes in length. The final byte of the field MUST contain the terminating null character."* — i.e. `MYFILE.TXT  \0`.

**Observed:** Windows for Workgroups 3.11 treats the 13-byte FileName field as a NUL-terminated C string starting at byte 0. With spec-compliant space padding, the File Manager UI shows entries as `FOOD       ` (spaces visible in column, can't be opened by name).

**What we do:** NUL-pad after the name (`FOOD\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0`). This matches Samba and NT4's behavior, and is what every real CIFS client actually expects.

**Where:** `service/smb/command_fs_search.go` — `formatSearchFileName`.

### SMB_COM_SEARCH MaxCount ([MS-CIFS] 2.2.4.58.1)

**Spec:** *"This value represents the maximum number of entries across the entirety of the search, not just the initial response."*

**Observed:** WfW 3.11 sends `MaxCount=1` on the initial Search request and `MaxCount=20` on every continuation. A strict session-wide reading would mean the first response exhausts the budget and we should immediately return ERRnofiles to every continuation — but WfW clearly expects the per-response semantics, and so does every other observed CIFS client.

**What we do:** Treat MaxCount as a per-response cap: return up to MaxCount entries from this call, retain the rest under the search handle for the next continuation.

**Where:** `service/smb/command_fs_search.go` — `handleSearch`.
